# Git Commit and Pull Request Guidelines

> **Related Skills**: See `incremental-commits` for breaking multi-file changes into atomic commits.

## When to Apply This Skill

Use this pattern when you need to:

- Write commit messages that follow conventional commit rules.
- Decide commit type/scope formatting and breaking-change notation.
- Draft PR descriptions as continuous narrative prose, opening with WHY.
- Add required user-facing changelog entries for `feat:`/`fix:` PRs.
- Review commit/PR text for anti-patterns like AI/tool attribution.

## References

Load these on demand based on what you're working on:

- If working with **changelog entries for `feat:`/`fix:` PRs**, read [references/changelog-entries.md](references/changelog-entries.md)
- If working with **PR description structure, API examples, and visual communication**, read [references/pull-request-guidelines.md](references/pull-request-guidelines.md)
- If working with **GitHub issue linking, username verification, or merge strategy**, read [references/github-pr-operations.md](references/github-pr-operations.md)

## Conventional Commits Format

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Commit Types

- `feat`: New features (correlates with MINOR in semantic versioning)
- `fix`: Bug fixes (correlates with PATCH in semantic versioning)
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or modifying tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks, dependency updates, etc.
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
- `build`: Changes to build system or dependencies
- `ci`: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts

### Scope Guidelines

- **Scope is OPTIONAL**: only add when it provides clarity
- Use lowercase, placed in parentheses after type: `feat(transcription):`
- Prefer specific component/module names over generic terms
- Your current practice is good: component names (`EditRecordingDialog`), feature areas (`transcription`, `sound`)
- Avoid overly generic scopes like `ui` or `backend` unless truly appropriate

### When to Use Scope

- When the change is localized to a specific component/module
- When it helps distinguish between similar changes
- When working in a large codebase with distinct areas

### When NOT to Use Scope

- When the change affects multiple areas equally
- When the type alone is sufficiently descriptive
- For small, obvious changes

### Description Rules

- Start with lowercase immediately after the colon and space
- Use imperative mood ("add" not "added" or "adds")
- No period at the end
- Keep under 50-72 characters on first line

### Breaking Changes & Version Bumps

Our monorepo uses a unified version scheme (`8.Y.Z`) where major version 8 is permanent:

- **Patch** (default): Every merged PR increments `Z` (e.g., `8.0.1` → `8.0.2`)
- **Minor**: Add `!` after type/scope: `feat(api)!: change endpoint structure` — increments `Y`, resets `Z`
- **Major**: Manual only. Reserved for "if ever needed." Do not use `!` expecting a major bump.

Include `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the commit footer with details when using `!`.

### Examples Following Your Style:

- `feat(transcription): add model selection for OpenAI providers`
- `fix(sound): resolve audio import paths in assets module`
- `refactor(EditRecordingDialog): implement working copy pattern`
- `docs(README): clarify cost comparison section`
- `chore: update dependencies to latest versions`
- `fix!: change default transcription API endpoint`

## Commit Messages Best Practices

### The "Why" is More Important Than the "What"

The commit message subject line describes WHAT changed. The commit body explains WHY.

**Good commit** (explains motivation):

```
fix(auth): prevent session timeout during file upload

Users were getting logged out mid-upload on large files because the
session refresh only triggered on navigation, not background activity.
```

**Bad commit** (only describes what):

```
fix(auth): add keepalive call to upload handler
```

The first commit tells future developers WHY the code exists. The second makes them dig through the code to understand the purpose.

### Other Best Practices

- NEVER include Claude Code or opencode watermarks or attribution
- Each commit should represent a single, atomic change
- Write commits for future developers (including yourself)
- If you need more than one line to describe what you did, consider splitting the commit

## What NOT to Include:

- `Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)`
- `Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>`
- Any references to AI assistance
- `Generated with [opencode](https://opencode.ai)`
- `Co-Authored-By: opencode <noreply@opencode.ai>`
- Tool attribution or watermarks
